# DTMF-controlled-bot
A simple Arduino-board based robot that can be driven remotely using a DTMF.DTMF controlled robot run by some commands that are  send via mobile phones.We are here using DTMF function of mobile phones.
We are using two phones- one is 'remote phone' and second one that is connected with Robot's circuit using aux wire.This phone is'Receiver phone'.
First we make a call using remote phone to receiver phone and then attend the call manually or automatic answer mode.So this DTMF controlled bot is controlled by phone.
When we presses '2' by remote phone ,robot start moving forward until next command comes.
When we presses '8' by remote phone ,robot change his state anfd start moving in backward direction until other command comes.
When we press '4', robot  turns left till next command executed.When '6' is pressed it turns right and '5' is used for stopping.
